DESCRIPTION:

Implementation of the template class HashMap <KeyT, T, hashFunction> in C ++.
KeyT - key type
T - value type
hashFunction - hash function

- Provides the ability to store <key, value> pairs in a hash table, possibly several elements with the same key (as in std :: unordered_multimap).
- An Open Addressing Algorithm is used to organize a hash table .
- Inserting and removing for O(n) time.
- Searching for one element in O(n) time, a set of elements with the same keys in O(n) time.
- Extension with rehasing in O(n) time, without calling the copy and key copy constructors.
- Thread safety (not yet verified)
- Unit tests
- Implementation allows you to set the used hash function as a template parameter.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TYPES:

- For KeyT operator "==" must be defined
- KeyT and T - must have a copy constructor (to search for equalRange and [])
- hashFunction - a function that takes three parameters input 
	std::size_t 	- dividend
	KeyT 			- key
	std::size_t 	- step
  and return std::size_t - hash of key

INSTRUCTIONS:

To build the library:
 make lib
 
To build tests: (library will builded with them)
 make tests
 
To run the tests:
 make check or ./run_tests.sh in the project root directory
 
To run a specific test, go to the "./build/test" directory and execute the executable file you need.
 
Cleaning:
 make clean - deletes all compiled binary files.
 make tests_clean - deletes all compiled binary files for tests.
